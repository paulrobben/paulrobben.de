      Here you can add some information about you. A small excerpt that describes
      your experience, for example.


      You explain something about your academic/study background, as well as your
      preferred areas of work. Think of this area as context-setting for the experience
      that you will describe below. Why did you change jobs? What drove you to take a
      new gig? Even if you are not looking for a job, it's a good way to hint about
      what kind of projects you are interested in.

      content: "Cold calling can be a great way to generate quality leads. You get to speak to the gatekeepers and stakeholders, and you get a great insight into their requirements and influences. But cold calling is an art-form. It can be daunting, it’s always a lot of work, and you always need to make a good impression."
